<p>It's actually very intuitive. Simply put, a calculator fixes everything that is wrong with eBooks! Let's see how..<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>They Provide Instant Gratification - </strong>Unlike eBooks, webinars etc., calculators requires much less time investment on the part of the customer but still provide a lot of value upfront. Hence, the conversion rates are extremely high!</li>
  <li><span></span><strong>Personalized and Interactive -</strong> Since they are inherently dynamic, calculators are more interesting than static blog posts or eBooks. They <i><strong>speak</strong></i> to the customer directly. This makes them fundamentally more share worthy on social media.</li>
  <li><strong>Build Trust</strong><strong> - </strong>Calculators provide transparency that strikes trust from the start. Many companies hide their pricing or value add behind a wall, but with a calculator you are able to directly address a customer’s major concerns.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusable Content</strong><strong> - </strong>They’re marketing campaigns with no expiry date - unlike content that’s read once and might be forgotten the next day.<br> </li>
  <li><strong>Sales Productivity</strong><strong> -</strong> They increase productivity of your sales team by providing rich data about the customer in the form of their preferences and needs, not just their phone number and email. This allows sales to really target their offers and calls.</li>
