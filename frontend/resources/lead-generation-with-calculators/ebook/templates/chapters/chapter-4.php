<p></p><p><strong>Calculators usually begin with a landing page (LP). </strong>
</p>
<p>The point here is to get the users excited about actually using the calculator and not “bounce”. The success of the landing page lies in low bounce rates. Here are some best practices that have shown to lower the bounce rates:<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be Clear. Upfront:</strong> The page headline should include keywords that clearly state what the calculator does. “Find the ROI of your content marketing” or “Calculate how much building an app really costs” are good examples in this context.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Explain Why Someone Should use Your Calculator:</strong> Once you have captured the interest, it helps to qualify your headline with a statement. Say, if your headline was “Find the RoI of X”, a good follow up to that will be ‘Make better decisions with a data-driven approach and don’t overpay like the rest’.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Try to use words like “Don’t overpay” or “Make sure you do not make a wrong decision” that evoke strong loss aversion emotions to increase conversion.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear Call to Action</strong>: This is required not only for the user to get started with the calculator but also because the number of clicks on it gives us data about what percentage of visitors liked your messaging and are actually interested in using the calculator. Example CTAs include “Get Cost Estimate” or “See How Much You’ll Save”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lead Generation Form:</strong> Ideally, this form should be at the end of the calculator, right before the results to maximize conversion. But in case the calculator is extremely long, then it makes sense to ask for the lead upfront as you are risking a high drop off in the middle of the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Graphics to Your Advantage:</strong> Use a relevant graphic that not only captures interest but also adds to the story. For example, some calculators’ LPs (landing pages) can showcase a sample result to give the customers a sense of what they are going to get after using the calculator. This has been found to increase conversion dramatically.</li>
</ul><p></p>
