<p></p><p>Not all forms are created equal, and the only way to get to the best form for your campaign is through constant testing and optimizing. The great part about web forms is that you can break them into chunks, and set analytics for each step, which shortens the process of A/B testing your page. This way, you can get a clear view on visitors’ behavior and map the trouble points that are crushing conversions.<br><strong><span style="color: rgb(146, 205, 220);"><br>A/B TESTING</span></strong><br>
</p>
<p>The premise of A/B testing is to create two versions of the same piece of marketing and test the results with a segment of your audience. Make sure to test different versions of the following elements to maximize conversion - you should only change one variable at a time.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong></strong><strong>Heading and sub heading of your landing page:</strong> A headline can cause users to convert, or bounce especially when you’re driving them from another PPC campaign where catching eyeballs is everything. Creating and testing different headlines for your landing page is necessary. If you need to, take out thirty minutes from your schedule, sit down with your team and create two killer headlines to test against each other.<br> </li>
  <li><strong></strong><strong>Number of inputs:</strong> So you’ve figured out what questions to ask and have decided for sure that you cannot do without ten questions. A/B test your tool against a shorter input number and look at how many leads reach the landing page. <br> </li>
  <li><strong></strong><strong>Number of fields in the lead gen form (where you ask for email info etc.):</strong> Are you asking for far too much information? Us marketers can get a little greedy when it comes to asking leads to part away with their contact details. However, an A/B test is a perfect way to see if you’re sounding too pushy in your lead gen form. <br> </li>
  <li><strong></strong><strong>Position of the lead generation form:</strong> Should you be placing your LG form before you display the results? Or after you’ve exhibited what your product can do? Find out the most strategic placement.</li>
</ul><p></p>
